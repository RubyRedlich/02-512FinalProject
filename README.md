This repository contains the code that we used to train, test, and visualize the results of our Hidden Markov Model.

The code for training the HMM via the Baum Welch algorithm is in the files "baum_welchv3.py" and "mult_seq_baum_welch.py". The code for predicting hidden states using the Viterbi algorithm is in the file "viterbi.py".
